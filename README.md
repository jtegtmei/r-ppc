## Why I'm buying PPC again
### Disclaimer

### Introduction
I first read the Peercoin [whitepaper](https://peercoin.net/assets/paper/peercoin-paper.pdf) back in 2013, and bought my first Peercoins in 2014, and I have been holding them since then. Now recently I have started buying more Peercoins again after taking a closer look at the project.

Before I give my reasons for why I ended up buying PPC, I'd like to shortly mention why I **didn't** buy as much of other hyped projects like Etherum.

#### Fair distribution, ICO
One of the first dealbreakers I look for when evaluating if a coin has potential, is to see if it has been premined or instamined like [ETH](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1147063.0) and [DASH](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1043923.0;imode). Premining, instamining and such are a dealbreaker to me not only from a moreal perspective, but also from a pragmatic perspective. From my experience, projects that start out with an unfair distribution tend to either end up with the developers running away with peoples money and dumping the project, or just it just dies a slow and natural death. But premining also tends to create unfavorable incentives towards pumping the coind, rather than the developers spend their time adding valuable code to the project and then get rewarded through donations for their work. There are several projects out there with fair distributions, and I'm convinced that [PPC](https://talk.peercoin.net/t/pillows-peercoin-myths/2518/58) is one of them.

#### Novelty and purpose
My primary reason for buying and holding altcoins is that I believe they are coming up with new innovations that holds potential value. Back when I bought my first Litecoins it was because I thought it had potential being used more for daily transactions than Bitcoin. Although the price hasn't been what I had hoped, in recent times I have found myself using Litecoin more and more for transferring value between exchanges. When I bought my first Peercoins it was because I thought the idea of its [Proof of Stake](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_Stake) protocol had potential. I didn't understand the ramifications for POS very well back then, but since the coin hadn't been hacked like the DAO, or dumped, I thought it wise to buy a small sum and add it to my portfolio like I'd learned from reading [The intelligent asset allocator](http://a.co/70z1zsM
).

## Why I'm buying PPC again
### Disclaimer
Naturally everything written here should be taken with great sceptisism. Show due diligence and fact-check everything stated.

### Introduction
I first read the Peercoin [whitepaper](https://peercoin.net/assets/paper/peercoin-paper.pdf) back in 2013, and bought my first Peercoins in 2014, and I have been holding them since then. Now recently I have started buying more Peercoins again after taking a closer look at the project.

Before I give my reasons for why I ended up buying PPC, I'd like to shortly mention why I **didn't** buy as much of other hyped projects like Etherum.
